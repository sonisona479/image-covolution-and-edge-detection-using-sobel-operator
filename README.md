Image Convolution
Convolution is a mathematical operation used in image processing to apply a filter (or kernel) to an image. This process involves sliding the kernel over the image and computing a weighted sum of pixel values. The result is a new image that highlights certain features, such as edges.

Edge Detection
Edge detection is a technique used to identify the boundaries within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness or color in the image.

Sobel Operator
The Sobel operator is a popular edge detection algorithm that uses two 3x3 convolution kernels (filters) to compute the gradient of the image intensity at each pixel. These kernels are designed to detect horizontal and vertical edges:

Horizontal Edge Detection Kernel: \[ \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Vertical Edge Detection Kernel: \[ \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -2 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Steps to Apply the Sobel Operator
Convert the Image to Grayscale: Edge detection works best on a single channel image.

Apply the Sobel Kernels: Convolve the image with the horizontal and vertical Sobel kernels separately.

Calculate the Gradient Magnitude: Combine the results of the horizontal and vertical convolutions to get the gradient magnitude at each pixel.

Thresholding (Optional): Apply a threshold to the gradient magnitude to create a binary image highlighting the edges.
